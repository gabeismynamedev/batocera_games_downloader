# Batocera PyGame Downloader
This app is not endorse any kind of piracy.

This is a simple tool to help download games to your console.

This is tested with Knulli RG35xxSP. I dont have time or desire to test in other console.

To install in your console, create a downloader foler inside the pygame roms folder and add those two files. 
Add your urls, I am giving examples using internet archive. ( I may delete those examples to avoid people to use to piracy).

Only download games you own a copy.
